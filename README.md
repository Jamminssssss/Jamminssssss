Hello, I'm Jae-min, an iOS developer.

# **Introduce**.

Always interested in new learning and interested in applying it to the project. Recently, I've been thinking about MVVM patterns and test codes and I'm interested in them.

I post new learning contents on my blog or YouTube and record them and use them as study materials whenever I have time.

I make an app that improves my usual inconveniences, and I make and distribute an app that I think I need.

In the process of making an app, I think my strengths are to solve various problems without giving up and to solve them patiently, and to approach them interestingly without being afraid of new learning.
